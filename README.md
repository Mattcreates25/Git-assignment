# Git-assignment
These are the steps for creating a repository on Git and github then linking them.


on the commandline 
```
mkdir git_assignment
```
this code makes a working directory called git_assignment

move into the working directory using:

```
cd git_assignment/
```
to be able to track the changes in our repository we use:

```
git init
```
this makes the directory a git repository

create a markdown file in the directory  for example

```
touch index.md
```

clone the repo you wish to merge to the repo you've just created

```
git clone git@github.com:Mattcreates25/understanding_Git.git

```

create another remote in this clone which directs us to the second repo
